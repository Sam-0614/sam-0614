## 💻 Code Snippet
Here’s an example of how I control the robotic arm using Python:

```python
import time
from robot_arm import RobotArm

# Initialize the robotic arm
arm = RobotArm()

# Move the arm to the specified position
arm.move_to(90, 90)

# Wait for a second
time.sleep(1)

# Grab an object
arm.grab()
```
