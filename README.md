# 👋 Hey there! Welcome to My GitHub!
So awesome to have you here! I'm **Samarth**, a robotics and programming geek, ready to share my adventures in tech. Here you'll find my projects, contributions, and a little bit about me.

⚡ Tech enthusiast by day, code wizard by night! I love building robots, crafting cool websites, and tackling all sorts of tech challenges. You could say I’m on a mission to prove that turning things off and on again really is a magic fix for most problems! When I'm not coding, you might find me geeking out over the latest robotics trends or just chilling with a good Netflix series or movie. Let’s dive into the tech world together!

## 🌟 My Vibe as a Gen Z Developer

Hey, welcome to my little corner of the internet! Here’s a peek into what I’m into these days:

- **Current Show:** Just finished *Stranger Things*—what a wild ride! 🎢
- **Favorite Game:** Totally obsessed with *Brawls star* right now. 🌾
- **Go-to Snack:** Gummy bears are my jam! 🍬
- **Current Hobby:** When I’m not coding, you can find me sketching or smashing it on the badminton court! 🏸

## 🚀 What’s Next?
Here’s what I’m cooking up for the future:
- [ ] Build a machine learning model to make robots not just smart—but psychic. Well, kind of. 🤖✨
- [ ] Whip up a mobile app so I can control my IoT gadgets while pretending to be on a top-secret mission. 📱💡
- [ ] Put together some fun robotics tutorials where I break down my experiments (and maybe a few circuits along the way). 🛠️📚
- [ ] Hackathon Madness—teaming up with awesome nerds to come up with the wildest ideas and get those creative gears spinning! 🎉💻

## 🤖 Let’s Learn Together!

Hey future techies! 👋 I’m all about sharing knowledge and helping each other grow. Here’s a peek into my wild learning journey:

- **Robotics Adventures**: So, picture this: I had a shiny new RC car, and instead of taking it for a spin, I thought, “What if I turned it into a fan?” Yup, I went full mad scientist and *broke that baby apart* for the motor! 🚗💥 Who knew making a battery-powered fan could lead to such a dramatic plot twist? But hey, sometimes you gotta sacrifice a little for the greater good! If I can pull this off, you totally can too!

- **Join My Journey**: Got a cool project you want to share? Or maybe you’re stuck on something? Hit me up on [Discord](https://discord.gg/beJJbh7q)! Let’s tackle challenges together!

## 💻 Code Snippet
Here’s an example of how I control the robotic arm using Python:

```python
import time
from robot_arm import RobotArm

# Initialize the robotic arm
arm = RobotArm()

# Move the arm to the specified position
arm.move_to(90, 90)

# Wait for a second
time.sleep(1)

# Grab an object
arm.grab()
```
